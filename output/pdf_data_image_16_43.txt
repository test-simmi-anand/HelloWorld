It was INovember. Although it was not yet late,
the sky was dark when I turned into Laun-

of the writing was old-fashioned, its heavily embellished capitals and curly flour-
ishes, my first impression vvas that it had been
written by a child. The letters seemed
untrained. Their uneven strokes either faded
into nothing or were heavily etched into the
paper. There vvas no sense of flow in the
letters that spelled out my name. Each had

prise. But I knew no children. That is when I
thought, It is thc hancl of an invalid.
